## Welcome to my Website!

### :purple_heart: :earth_africa: :purple_heart:

My name is LinkHpp, a programmer who wants to learn everything I can about computers but mostly about low level stuff and retro consoles. 

Now I'm working on an emulator of the Chip-8, learning about kernels and learning how to use SDL2.
